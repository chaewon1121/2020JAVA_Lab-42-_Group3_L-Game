## What is L-game?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_game
<br>
The L game is a two-player game played on a board of 4×4 squares. Each player has a 3×2 L-shaped piece, and there are two 1×1 neutral pieces. 

On each turn, a player must first move their L piece, and then may optionally move one of the neutral pieces. The game is won by leaving the opponent unable to move their L piece to a new position.

Pieces may not overlap or cover other pieces. On moving the L piece, it is picked up and then placed in empty squares anywhere on the board. It may be rotated or even flipped over in doing so; the only rule is that it must end in a different position from the position it started—thus covering at least one square it did not previously cover. To move a neutral piece, a player simply picks it up then places it in an empty square anywhere on the board.

## How can I play it?

First, download this whole respository, and save them in the same folder(including all the png files!). After that, first execute the LgameServer.java. It will ask you to input the first player's nickname. Once you input the first player's nickname, it will show the computer's binding and port number. After that, execute the LgameClient.java and type in the server address provided in the LgameServer. Type the information in the form of Binding/Port. Once inputted correctly, it will ask you to input the second player's nickname. Type the nickname, and enjoy the game!
